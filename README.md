# ProceduralGenerationConsole

A repository containing multiple procedural generation algorithms for 2d topdown game level generation. Created for [Spellbound Citadel](https://jael137.itch.io/spellbound-citadel-webgl)

## Roompath algorithm

Generates a few random rooms and creates paths between them using Astar.

## Random walk algorithm

Uses walkers to carve paths, and places the occasional room.

## Perlin algorithm

This algorithm clamps perlin noise to create cavelike levels.

## Credits

Everything made by me, except [Fastnoise.cs](https://github.com/Auburn/FastNoise_CSharp/blob/master/FastNoise.cs).
